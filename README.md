# Kaitai Struct: runtime library for PHP

This library implements Kaitai Struct API for PHP.

Kaitai Struct is a declarative language used for describe various binary
data structures, laid out in files or in memory: i.e. binary file
formats, network stream packet formats, etc.

The library can be used as part of Kaitai Struct or independently (see PHP-specific notes below).
